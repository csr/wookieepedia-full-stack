# wookieepedia-full-stack

## Welcome in!

Welcome, Star War fan! We're so excited to have you here. Wookieepedia is a full-stack project divided into two applications:

* A frontend React application written with TypeScript.
* A backend application written with Java and using the XYZ library.

This full-stack application uses data from [swapi](https://swapi.dev/), a Star Wars API.

## Behind the scenes

We make te assumption that the [swapi](https://swapi.dev/) data will not change often. After all, it's not every day that a new Star Wars movie comes out. We can therefore save the entire dataset in the backend application and then serve from that dataset. This way our backend application can handle a lot of traffic and more tan the [10,000 request per day](https://swapi.dev/documentation#rate) supported by the [swapi](https://swapi.dev/).
