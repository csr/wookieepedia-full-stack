# Wookieepedia! ðŸŒŒðŸ”«

## Welcome in!

Welcome, Star War fan! We're so excited to have you here. May the _code_ be with you as you navigate through the project! 

Wookieepedia! is a full-stack project divided into two applications:

* A frontend React application written with TypeScript.
* A backend application written with Java and using the XYZ library.

This full-stack application uses data from [swapi](https://swapi.dev/), a Star Wars API.

## Getting Started

First off, ensure you have Docker installed. You can either download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (easier to use but it requires a license if you're working in an enterprise) or [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script) directly.

Let's clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csr/wookieepedia-full-stack.git
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file helps you run both the frontend and backend applications at the same time.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you're getting some authentication error you may first need to 

```bash
docker login
```

## Running the tests
...

## Do you want to build the Docker images one by one?

This step is not necessary because Docker Compose will automatically build and start all the Docker containers for you. However, you can build and run Docker containers one by one if you so decide (useful if you want to try out changes in a single `Dockerfile` file or want to test just the frontend or backend). Let us first navigate to the frontend project:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Let's build the image and assign the `frontend` tag to it:

```bash
docker build -t frontend .
```

Once that is done we can run it:

```bash
docker run -p 6969:3000 frontend
```

Open http://localost:6969 and have fun interacting with Wookieepedia!

You can run the following command to see a list of the running containers on your machine:

```bash
docker ps
```

You can kill it by indicating the container ID:

```bash
docker stop <container_id_here>
```

## Behind the scenes

We make the assumption that the [swapi](https://swapi.dev/) data will not change often. After all, it's not every day that a new Star Wars movie comes out. We can therefore save the entire dataset in the backend application and then serve from that dataset. This way our backend application can handle a lot of traffic and more tan the [10,000 request per day](https://swapi.dev/documentation#rate) supported by the [swapi](https://swapi.dev/).
