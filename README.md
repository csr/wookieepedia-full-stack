# wookieepedia-full-stack

## Welcome in!

Welcome, Star War fan! We're so excited to have you here. Wookieepedia is a full-stack project divided into two applications:

* A frontend React application written with TypeScript.
* A backend application written with Java and using the XYZ library.

This full-stack application uses data from [swapi](https://swapi.dev/), a Star Wars API.
